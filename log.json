  "It's not easy to get going and then once I get going I feel like I should stop because I've had to start over so much just by perfecting things. \nI guess I work with a lot of projects that are vulnerable to perfectionism.\n\nEither way, today my plan is to get this log onto the Github the way that it is. \n                \n      If it goes the way I want I can have a good log with a list of my local to-do's. Maybe I can make my OWN Jira like Kanban board... although I think a physical one might be better for me. \n\n      If I described all of the issues I had just STARTING this log, I would lose an hr. Oh man... DAYS if I really went into \"I first started to make a blog with a database..\"\n\n      Either way, thanks to Chat GPT for helping me out. It's just a lot quicker to get it going if you understand a little bit about it. I can tell it's in a spot where if I keep going I can get permanent results and that's EXACTLY what I am after.",

The walls, raw concrete painted white.\r\n       The music: Stereo MC's \"Connected\" from my \"Growin Up\" Spotify mix.\r\n The smell, weed and incense.\r\n\r\n    The lighting: overhead shitty white light bars, good for drawing, bad for computing. \r\n\r\n   I'm 43, born and raised in Saginaw Michigan, moved to Los Angeles for five years 2003 - 2008\r\n        Didn't do ANYTHING I went there to do, break into the film industry, write, direct, film, choreograph a movie, or TV show.\r\n          Met my wife Chi, travelled a bit.\r\n                                 Worked at wholefoods for 8 years till 2016\r\n                                    Went to school and took a break to tackle alcoholism.\r\n                                          Got into programming. \r\n                                            Got a job through friends at a good business, #1` now in Mortgages, and got some money too. \r\n\r\n\r\n    Now I'm a release coordinator, and the stress is madness because the whole entire companies website is on your shoulders often times.\r\n\r\n     I set up this website using help with CHATGPT 4. AI that is getting better more and more rapidly. I understood enough of it to save me some serious time. It's not perfect yet. \r\n\r\n      I'm about to take a trip to Denver to see my good friend Sean Galaviz and get some inspiration. It should be great to feel and breathe the Denver air.",

I need to focus on the character designs of Gabby, Michael, July, Gabby's Mom, and the Bully and his dad, get some practice with gesture, figure and motion.\r\nHere's my basic list for next month.\r\n\r\n1. Character design.\r\n2. Framework research and decision.\r\n3. 60 hrs of practice.\r\n4. Large project decision\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's really nice to give myself a month to do anything.
